## 10/23/2025 1:19 AM - First sketch of arm  

Kicked things off with a rough sketch of one drone arm. Kinda freestyled it at first just to get the proportions right. It’s giving low poly energy but it’s fine for now. Started defining anchor points, main circles, and a flat reference. Just wanted to see something on screen ngl. Didn’t go too deep. Mostly just sketch and vibe.![arm sketch.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUyOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--99f9c3b63da9ac1db6c1b56b4e3256095ffb778f/arm%20sketch.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 1:25 AM - Added dimensions and holes  

Went full nerd and started dimensioning everything. Dialed in the hole placements to ±0.01 mm. The arm got some realistic mounting holes too. I used the "Fix" constraint like a cheat code. The goal was making one arm perfect so I can mirror it later. Honestly, this part was surprisingly fun, takes a hell lot of planning to do such a small thing :sob:![main body.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUyOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--35deb0117c12c3a0e720f48bfd6780d0f252f884/main%20body.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 1:29 AM - Mirrored full arm layout  

Time to go symmetric. Mirrored that one finished arm into four. Boom X-frame instantly. Seeing it all align felt good. I tweaked a bit to keep everything smooth and centered. Even added mid-line constraints to avoid future chaos. Very chill but satisfying work session.![solid body.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUzMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3dd8e8cbebad5fb5428b2e01e5eda29b88e3d6f0/solid%20body.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 2 PM - Finalized arm + center  

Today was clean-up and contour day. I cut a neat circular slot in the center and shaved off weird edges. Played around with how the arms curve into the center plate. Tried to keep it modular so one break doesn’t destroy the whole thing. Saving this design now felt way more solid.![finalized arm + center.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDY4NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c54db014ad30530477ad43c5b78689734c8a51b7/finalized%20arm%20%2B%20center.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 3 PM - Arms joined to center plate  

Assembled the center + arm units for the first time. Arms looked sharp. Made sure each arm was removable. Spaced things out so M3 screws could fit in nicely. I think we’re officially in the “it looks like a drone” phase. Had to fix a few weird shell merge issues too.![Arms joined to center plate.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDcxMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--00c241e5a05f78c896c0f21f86a0736816f30c20/Arms%20joined%20to%20center%20plate.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 4 PM - Overlapping fix + cleanup  

The overlapping bits between arm and mid-plate were bugging me. So I made a clean cut that fits like a socket. No glue or junky fits needed. Played with clearance values too. Hoping this makes disassembly a breeze in the field. Bonus points for modularity.![Overlapping fix + cleanup.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDcxNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--db98be0b630cfcb559df3bad6cd9988fcedfde4f/Overlapping%20fix%20%2B%20cleanup.png)
  

## 10/24/2025 5:03 PM - Adjusted arms and motor holes  

Revisited motor mount designs after checking motor specs again. Standardized everything around a 23mm M2 bolt pattern. Realized I forgot to offset the motor cable exits fixed that too. Pretty confident the frame arms are done unless someone finds a flaw.

## 10/24/2025 5:05 PM - First assembly + mounts  

Stacked in the standoffs to complete the sandwich design. The frame started to look like it came off a store shelf. Gave it more volume, added screw holes to lock the standoffs into the plates. No flex no wobble. Can’t wait to slap components on it once it's printed.

## 10/26/2025 12:26 AM - Final modular frame render  

Final render. Final sanity checks. Did a full dry run of what components will go where. Sent over screenshots to friends for peer feedback. Thinking of getting it CNC’d instead of 3D printing now. Frame’s 100% ready for slicing but still waiting on project grant approval.

## 10/26/2025 12:38 AM - transmitter pcb  

this is what I use to control the drone. it sends signals to the receiver, like throttle, yaw, pitch, and roll basically all the movement stuff, having fun in blueprint so far

## 10/26/2025 11:32 AM - made the receiver board  

the receiver board was super tiny, so i had to be careful with the layout. placed the antenna module first, then worked my way around it. i routed the power lines thick and clean, then squeezed the signal traces into whatever space was left. kept everything low-noise and added filtering caps close to the power input and near the data lines.![receiver pcb](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTYzNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5955f25ed93aa0a03996b932b42ddd0153462b8f/receiver%20pcb.png)
  

## 10/26/2025 11:34 AM - designing the fc pcb  

designing the FC PCB was kinda the most intense part. this thing connects everything ESCs, receiver, gyro, USB, power , so routing got hectic fast. i started with the MPU and MCU, placed them dead center to keep the traces equal.

## 10/26/2025 11:48 AM - controller case design  

The design of the controller case turned out to be much more challenging than anticipated.  Without becoming a brick, this section needed to balance internal space, ergonomics, and clean aesthetics.  I began by setting up the joysticks because everything else is centered around them.  The top shell was then sculpted to preserve the comfortable angles and organic grip.  Primarily functional, the lower part offered enough depth for PCB mounts, wiring, and connectors.  To align the mounting holes and make sure the top and bottom closed flush, multiple test fits were required.  I ended up chamfering the edges a little to give it that crisp, machined feel.![controller case](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTYzOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--dadbf3c551375d4c4b08e963ed6335f4471d1795/controller%20case.png)
