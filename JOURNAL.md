## 10/23/2025 1:19 AM - First sketch of arm  

Kicked things off with a rough sketch of one drone arm. Kinda freestyled it at first just to get the proportions right. It’s giving low poly energy but it’s fine for now. Started defining anchor points, main circles, and a flat reference. Just wanted to see something on screen ngl. Didn’t go too deep. Mostly just sketch and vibe.![arm sketch.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUyOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--99f9c3b63da9ac1db6c1b56b4e3256095ffb778f/arm%20sketch.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 1:25 AM - Added dimensions and holes  

Went full nerd and started dimensioning everything. Dialed in the hole placements to ±0.01 mm. The arm got some realistic mounting holes too. I used the "Fix" constraint like a cheat code. The goal was making one arm perfect so I can mirror it later. Honestly, this part was surprisingly fun, takes a hell lot of planning to do such a small thing :sob:![main body.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUyOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--35deb0117c12c3a0e720f48bfd6780d0f252f884/main%20body.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 1:29 AM - Mirrored full arm layout  

Time to go symmetric. Mirrored that one finished arm into four. Boom X-frame instantly. Seeing it all align felt good. I tweaked a bit to keep everything smooth and centered. Even added mid-line constraints to avoid future chaos. Very chill but satisfying work session.![solid body.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUzMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3dd8e8cbebad5fb5428b2e01e5eda29b88e3d6f0/solid%20body.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 2 PM - Finalized arm + center  

Today was clean-up and contour day. I cut a neat circular slot in the center and shaved off weird edges. Played around with how the arms curve into the center plate. Tried to keep it modular so one break doesn’t destroy the whole thing. Saving this design now felt way more solid.![finalized arm + center.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDY4NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c54db014ad30530477ad43c5b78689734c8a51b7/finalized%20arm%20%2B%20center.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 3 PM - Arms joined to center plate  

Assembled the center + arm units for the first time. Arms looked sharp. Made sure each arm was removable. Spaced things out so M3 screws could fit in nicely. I think we’re officially in the “it looks like a drone” phase. Had to fix a few weird shell merge issues too.![Arms joined to center plate.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDcxMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--00c241e5a05f78c896c0f21f86a0736816f30c20/Arms%20joined%20to%20center%20plate.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 4 PM - Overlapping fix + cleanup  

The overlapping bits between arm and mid-plate were bugging me. So I made a clean cut that fits like a socket. No glue or junky fits needed. Played with clearance values too. Hoping this makes disassembly a breeze in the field. Bonus points for modularity.![Overlapping fix + cleanup.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDcxNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--db98be0b630cfcb559df3bad6cd9988fcedfde4f/Overlapping%20fix%20%2B%20cleanup.png)
  

## 10/24/2025 5:03 PM - Adjusted arms and motor holes  

Revisited motor mount designs after checking motor specs again. Standardized everything around a 23mm M2 bolt pattern. Realized I forgot to offset the motor cable exits fixed that too. Pretty confident the frame arms are done unless someone finds a flaw.

## 10/24/2025 5:05 PM - First assembly + mounts  

Stacked in the standoffs to complete the sandwich design. The frame started to look like it came off a store shelf. Gave it more volume, added screw holes to lock the standoffs into the plates. No flex no wobble. Can’t wait to slap components on it once it's printed.

## 10/26/2025 12:26 AM - Final modular frame render  

Final render. Final sanity checks. Did a full dry run of what components will go where. Sent over screenshots to friends for peer feedback. Thinking of getting it CNC’d instead of 3D printing now. Frame’s 100% ready for slicing but still waiting on project grant approval.

## 10/26/2025 12:38 AM - transmitter pcb  

I spent today working on the transmitter board, which is the main controller for the drone. Pitch, roll, yaw, throttle, and all other significant signals sent to the receiver are all controlled by it; in other words, it controls every facet of flight control.

It was made to look like a handheld controller, which makes it comfortable and simple to use. I also added a custom silkscreen with my tag just a small signature to show that I built it.

I spent some time fine-tuning the schematic before starting layout to ensure that every connection, switch, and potentiometer mapped to the control logic. Having a clean schematic made it much simpler to keep the wiring organized while building the PCB. I'm quite happy with the way the blueprint is developing so far.

## 10/26/2025 11:32 AM - made the receiver board  

The FPV drone's receiver board was ridiculously tiny, so I had to be very careful with the layout. I built everything else around the antenna module after I had it installed. It was like solving a puzzle with traces. kept the power lines neat and thick while carefully packing the signal traces into the remaining areas. Filtering capacitors were placed close to the data and power input lines to cut down on noise.

Worked hard on the schematic as well; double-check all connections, label everything clearly, and ensure that the layout exactly matches the schematic. The board is one of the cleanest I've made so far, despite its small size.![receiver pcb](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTYzNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5955f25ed93aa0a03996b932b42ddd0153462b8f/receiver%20pcb.png)

## 10/26/2025 11:34 AM - designing the fc pcb  

The flight controller (FC) PCB design was, to be honest, the most difficult part of the build so far. Because this board connects everything ESCs, receiver, gyro, USB, and power the routing soon became complex. I started by placing the MPU and MCU dead center to preserve balanced trace lengths and unobstructed signal paths.

Before beginning layout, I spent a fair amount of time working on the schematic, making sure that all of the connections, pin mapping, and component labels were perfect. When the schematic was clean and organized,

## 10/26/2025 11:48 AM - controller case design  

The design of the controller case turned out to be much more challenging than anticipated.  Without becoming a brick, this section needed to balance internal space, ergonomics, and clean aesthetics.  I began by setting up the joysticks because everything else is centered around them.  The top shell was then sculpted to preserve the comfortable angles and organic grip.  Primarily functional, the lower part offered enough depth for PCB mounts, wiring, and connectors.  To align the mounting holes and make sure the top and bottom closed flush, multiple test fits were required.  I ended up chamfering the edges a little to give it that crisp, machined feel.![controller case](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTYzOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--dadbf3c551375d4c4b08e963ed6335f4471d1795/controller%20case.png)
  

## 10/28/2025 - updated the cart prize of jlcpcb cart  

I accidentally submitted the JLCPCB cart with a PCB thickness of 2mm instead of the required 1.6mm. Even though I hadn't noticed it at first, I was lucky to find it before everything was finalised. It should continue to be lighter and more mounting-standard now that I've switched back to 1.6mm.

I have also added pictures of the schematic, included two screenshots of the JLCPCB cart, and improved the detail of my journal entries for appropriate documentation. I feel more organised now that I have the build logs.![Screenshot 2025-10-28 092413](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjEzNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--82b4a199774b66dac705d66e8da37728a4390448/Screenshot%202025-10-28%20092413.png)
