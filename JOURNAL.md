## 10/23/2025 1:19 AM - First sketch of arm  

Kicked things off with a rough sketch of one drone arm. Kinda freestyled it at first just to get the proportions right. It’s giving low poly energy but it’s fine for now. Started defining anchor points, main circles, and a flat reference. Just wanted to see something on screen ngl. Didn’t go too deep. Mostly just sketch and vibe.![arm sketch.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUyOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--99f9c3b63da9ac1db6c1b56b4e3256095ffb778f/arm%20sketch.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 1:25 AM - Added dimensions and holes  

Went full nerd and started dimensioning everything. Dialed in the hole placements to ±0.01 mm. The arm got some realistic mounting holes too. I used the "Fix" constraint like a cheat code. The goal was making one arm perfect so I can mirror it later. Honestly, this part was surprisingly fun, takes a hell lot of planning to do such a small thing :sob:![main body.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUyOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--35deb0117c12c3a0e720f48bfd6780d0f252f884/main%20body.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 1:29 AM - Mirrored full arm layout  

Time to go symmetric. Mirrored that one finished arm into four. Boom X-frame instantly. Seeing it all align felt good. I tweaked a bit to keep everything smooth and centered. Even added mid-line constraints to avoid future chaos. Very chill but satisfying work session.![solid body.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUzMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3dd8e8cbebad5fb5428b2e01e5eda29b88e3d6f0/solid%20body.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 2 PM - Finalized arm + center  

Today was clean-up and contour day. I cut a neat circular slot in the center and shaved off weird edges. Played around with how the arms curve into the center plate. Tried to keep it modular so one break doesn’t destroy the whole thing. Saving this design now felt way more solid.![finalized arm + center.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDY4NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c54db014ad30530477ad43c5b78689734c8a51b7/finalized%20arm%20%2B%20center.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 3 PM - Arms joined to center plate  

Assembled the center + arm units for the first time. Arms looked sharp. Made sure each arm was removable. Spaced things out so M3 screws could fit in nicely. I think we’re officially in the “it looks like a drone” phase. Had to fix a few weird shell merge issues too.![Arms joined to center plate.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDcxMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--00c241e5a05f78c896c0f21f86a0736816f30c20/Arms%20joined%20to%20center%20plate.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 4 PM - Overlapping fix + cleanup  

The overlapping bits between arm and mid-plate were bugging me. So I made a clean cut that fits like a socket. No glue or junky fits needed. Played with clearance values too. Hoping this makes disassembly a breeze in the field. Bonus points for modularity.![Overlapping fix + cleanup.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDcxNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--db98be0b630cfcb559df3bad6cd9988fcedfde4f/Overlapping%20fix%20%2B%20cleanup.png)
  

## 10/24/2025 5:03 PM - Adjusted arms and motor holes  

Revisited motor mount designs after checking motor specs again. Standardized everything around a 23mm M2 bolt pattern. Realized I forgot to offset the motor cable exits fixed that too. Pretty confident the frame arms are done unless someone finds a flaw.

## 10/24/2025 5:05 PM - First assembly + mounts  

Stacked in the standoffs to complete the sandwich design. The frame started to look like it came off a store shelf. Gave it more volume, added screw holes to lock the standoffs into the plates. No flex no wobble. Can’t wait to slap components on it once it's printed.
