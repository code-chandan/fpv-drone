## 10/23/2025 - First sketch of arm  

Kicked things off with a rough sketch of one drone arm. Kinda freestyled it at first just to get the proportions right. It’s giving low poly energy but it’s fine for now. Started defining anchor points, main circles, and a flat reference. Just wanted to see something on screen ngl. Didn’t go too deep. Mostly just sketch and vibe.![arm sketch.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUyOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--99f9c3b63da9ac1db6c1b56b4e3256095ffb778f/arm%20sketch.png)
