# Aero FPV Drone

Aero is that one FPV drone you design in your head during boring lectures and then actually build when you finally have the time and brainpower. It’s a freestyle rig that’s super lightweight, fully custom, and made to do flips, dives, and maybe crash a few times without crying.

This thing isn’t printed yet, btw. The model is locked and loaded in Fusion 360. Big shoutout to **@toby** on hc Slack for helping me pick the right motors and reviewing the design before it even existed IRL. Legend move.

## what came into my mind when i designed it

Aero was designed from scratch in Fusion 360 with the idea of keeping things modular, fixable, and crash-forgiving. The frame uses custom top and bottom plates that can either be 3D printed in PLA+ or laser-cut in carbon fiber if budget allows. The arms are separated for easier swaps when the inevitable faceplant happens. Every screw, standoff, and capacitor has its space.

It’s got that “I-built-this-in-my-room” energy but backed by a parts list that can punch with the big brands. The wiring is gonna be clean thanks to the 4-in-1 ESC stack, and the VTX and analog cam give it old-school FPV vibes without sacrificing clarity.
